This repository presents a feasibility study on automating the adjudication process for reverse mortgage applications in Canada using machine learning. It explores predictive modeling techniques—including Decision Trees, KNN, and Logistic Regression—to assess creditworthiness and streamline decision-making. The project aims to reduce manual workload, improve adjudication accuracy, and deliver measurable financial impact, including a projected ROI of 1.7 and $3.6M in shareholder value. The study was conducted as part of a job interview process and led to a successful offer—which was ultimately declined due to ethical concerns around reverse mortgages as a long-term financial tool for lifestyle funding.
